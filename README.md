# ðŸŒŒ Earth and Moon Wormhole Research

This project explores the theoretical possibility of constructing a stable traversable wormhole between Earth and Moon.  
It is based on gravitational curvature, Lagrange points, and negative energy (Casimir effect).  
The research paper includes original diagrams and detailed appendix.
